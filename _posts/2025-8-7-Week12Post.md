### What did you do last week?
Last week was one of the busiest of the semester. I focused on combining all elements of my project into a single, organized GitHub repository as well as creating the final data visualization plots using Python. This step required me to learn new Python libraries and techniques that hadn’t been part of my original project schedule so took me a bit more time than normal 

### What do you plan to do this week?
This week, I plan to finalize the structure of the visualizations and ensure they’re clearly integrated into both the GitHub repo and my personal website. I’ll also continue refining the presentation of my code and final project report

### Are there any impediments in your way?
A would say an impediment was having to quickly build new Python skills to create effective visualizations. It slowed my progress a little but I worked through it by using online resources and examples.

### Reflection on the process:
Looking back I realize I could have allocated more time earlier in the project to explore Python’s data visualization tools since it was in my original final project paper idea. Moving forward i will keep additional skills in mind and build more buffer time into my schedule for additional learning.
