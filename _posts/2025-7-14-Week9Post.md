### What did you do last week?
Last week I organized my workflow started to draft structure on my data to track progress. started outlining the types of figures I want to include in my final report. And then i continued to stick to my schedule with Python and C and  I managed to stay on schedule which has been really motivating.

### What do you plan on working on this week?
This week, I plan to continue working on my scheduled questions for the week and then continue some review in both Python and C, I also want to start documenting some of the solutions more clearly so they can potentially be included in my final report. I will write out some comments on previous questions but i think keeping my comments neater and easier to understand would be helpful.

### Are there any impediments in your way?
None at the moment.

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last weekâ€™s process felt really productive. Breaking down problems and staying consistent with my schedule helped me make steady progress. I plan to set more specific daily goals and continue wit my schedule!
