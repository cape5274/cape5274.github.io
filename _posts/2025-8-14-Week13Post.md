### What did you do last week?
This past week, I focused on updating and finalizing my personal website. I improved the layout, added final project components, and submitted my final report. It was exciting to see the project come together visually and to reflect on all the progress Iâ€™ve made.

### What do you plan to do this week?
With the project now wrapped up my goal is to clean up any remaining items, ensure everything is published properly and then enjoy a few weeks off and take up another hobby

Are there any impediments in your way?
There were no major blockers this week, mainly the usual challenge of balancing multiple assignments and final deadlines. Staying organized and following my schedule helped keep things on track.

Reflection on the process:
This project reinforced how essential it is to practice and review technical skills regularly. Computer science is a field where continuous learning is part of the journey. I appreciated the process and felt that sticking to a weekly plan and weekly posts really paid off.
