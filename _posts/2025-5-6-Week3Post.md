## Week 3 

### What did you do last week ###
Last week, I focused on finalizing my project idea for the course. I spent time reviewing the feedback I received from my instructor and classmates, which helped me clarify my direction. This planning phase was important to ensure the project would be both meaningful and manageable given my schedule. 
### What are you planning on doing this week ###
This week, I completed my formal project proposal and created a 9-week schedule to guide my progress. I will also participate in peer reviews to provide feedback on others’ proposals and receive additional insight into my own. These steps will help ensure I’m on track and that the project meets expectations before I dive into the technical work.
### Are there any impediments in your way? ###
The biggest potential challenge right now is awaiting feedback from peer reviews, which may require me to adjust parts of my plan. Once that’s complete, I’ll be able to move forward confidently with the first round of problem-solving and reflection.
### Reflection on progress and improvements ###
I feel that I’m off to a strong and organized start. Taking time to thoroughly plan out the structure and schedule of my project has helped reduce uncertainty and will keep me accountable. I’ll continue to monitor any changes that might affect the pace or scope of the project, especially with other commitments. Overall, I’m happy with the progress so far and feel more confident heading into the next phase
