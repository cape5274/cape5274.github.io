### What did you do last week?
I updated my project schedule to focus only on core areas of C (like pointers, linked lists, and syntax) instead of trying to cover everything. I also tried to stay on top of my practice schedule, but it was difficult due to traveling, being sick, as well as my vacation but i still managed to get some work in even if progress was slower.

### What do you plan to do this week?
Now that I’m back home, I plan to get back into my regular routine This week I’ll focus on solving problems related to stacks and queues in Python  and then catching up on some C topics/catching up on tracker entries and reflection notes.

### Are there any impediments in your way?
Not at the moment being home should help me get back into a good workflow. but i would say maybe having a bit of catching up t do than previous weeks 

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Last week showed me how important it is to stick to a schedule without a stable routine. This week, I’ll try breaking my tasks into smaller daily goals so I can keep making steady progress even when things get busy. I would say maybe working towards getting ahead of schedule instead of staying on it.
