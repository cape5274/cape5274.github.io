### What did I do last week?
Last week, I continued working on the final report and I decided to supplement my understanding by using additional resources such as LinkedIn Learning. I focused on topics such as Markdown formatting and the appropriate use of comments in code and documentation. While it’s difficult to track or quantify the exact progress made through these platforms, the knowledge I gained has been useful and relevant to my work.

### What do I plan to do this week?
My main goal is to complete and submit the final report including  everything I’ve worked on and make sure the documentation is well made and understandable

### Are there any impediments in your way?
There aren’t any major blockers at the moment. The only challenge is integrating informal learning such as the linked in learning courses, into the report in a meaningful way since they don’t have clear ways of tracking progress.

### Reflection on the process
I’ve found that taking time to explore external learning resources helped me clarify things I had been unsure about like formatting, markdown documentation, and commenting best practices.
