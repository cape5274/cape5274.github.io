### What did you do last week?
Last week, I submitted my project proposal and gave feedback to a few of my peers. It was helpful to read their ideas and compare their proposals detail to mine. I also got started with Python Problems and logging attributes related to my project.

### What do you plan to do this week?
This week, I’m reviewing the feedback I received on my proposal and making sure I stay on schedule. I also read through the professor’s comments and started exploring some of the resources he suggested. In addition, I’m continuing to set up the Excel file I’ll be using to log and track my project data. and using Jupyter Notebook for the final part of my project.

### Are there any impediments in your way?
Nope everything is going smoothly so far. Just focusing on sticking to the timeline I created and making sure that I don't skip progress

### Reflection on the process you used last week – how can you make the process work better?
I’m enjoying the project so far! Working through this independently has already helped me approach problems more thoughtfully. It feels good to be learning and problem solving in coding languages outside of a traditional class setting it’s definitely helping me absorb the material in a deeper way.
