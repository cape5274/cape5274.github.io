# Project Proposal  Summer 2025

CSPB-3112 SUMMER 2025
Date: 06/05/2025

### Vision Statement 
To build a strong foundation in two languages that have already been introduced to by completing a structured self guided practice plan using online coding platforms. This project will help cultivate skills critical for technical job interviews and long term success in development roles. 
### Motivation
As I am nearing the completion of the CSPB program and am beginning a new position as a student intern on a Data Management Team in a few weeks I picked this project as it will support my career goals and time availability, Practicing Python, C and solving algorithm problems is a meaningful way to improve my skills to increase confidence and prepare for real world technical interviews in manageable self pace way. 
### Learning Objective 
With the completion of this project I aim to: 
Strengthen core Python/C programming skills 
Develop effective problem - solving strategies 
Gain Confidence in breaking down dolving technical coding questions 
Improve familiarity with key algorithms topics
Document learning growth through tracking and reflection.
Use python or C to use the display the data that I have collected throughout this project 
### Risk 
Risk: Split focus between Python and C may hinder deeper understanding of either language.  
Mitigation: Focus on completing goals in one language before moving to the other.

Risk: Limited time due to internship and coursework could disrupt consistent progress.  
Mitigation: Schedule shorter, manageable practice sessions and allow flexibility in weekly goals.

Risk: Challenging problems may cause frustration or delays in the schedule.  
Mitigation: Begin with easier problems, increase difficulty gradually, and revisit hard problems later.

Risk: Lack of external feedback might slow progress or leave knowledge gaps.  
Mitigation: Use weekly reflections, track progress, and publish work on GitHub for accountability and self-review.
### Project Assessment 
The project will be evaluated on: 
Completion of detailed problem solving tracker 
Weekly reflection journal with summaries of reviewed or newly learned concepts 
Final report summarizing key skills gain, trends in time managements and improvements, 
Evidence Of consistent structured practice over the 9-week period.

### Schedule: 
Rough Draft - I used Chat GPT to help me but this is preliminary! 

| Week | Focus Area | Goals | Hours |
|------|------------|-------|-------|
|  1 | Project setup + Arrays| Set up tracker, choose platforms, solve 3–4 array problems | 5|
| 2  | Strings | Solve 4–5 string-based problems, log insights  | 5 |
| 3  | Hash Maps / Sets |Practice lookup & frequency problems, log time & methods | 5 |
| 4  | Recursion + Backtracking (light) |Solve 3 problems + reflect on recursion techniques | 5 |
| 5  | Linked Lists | Practice 4–5 problems, understand traversal + manipulation |  5 |
| 6 | Stacks & Queues | Focus on logic-based problems and LIFO/FIFO use cases | 5 |
| 7 | Searching & Sorting | Review binary search, bubble/merge sort, solve challenges | 5 |
| 8 | Mixed Review / Harder Problems | Choose 4–5 mixed problems, reflect on overall progress | 5 |
| 9 | Final Report + Reflection | Summarize growth, lessons learned, document overall impact | 5 |
