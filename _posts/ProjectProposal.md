# Project Proposal  Summer 2025

CSPB-3112 SUUMMER 2025

### Vision Statement 
To build a strong foundation in two languages that have already been introduced to by completing a structured self guided practice plan using online coding platforms. This project will help cultivate skills critical for technical job interviews and long term success in development roles. 
### Motivation
As I am nearing the completion of the CSPB program and am beginning a new position as a student intern on a Data Management Team in a few weeks I picked this project as it will support my career goals and time availability, Practicing Python, C and solving algorithm problems is a meaningful way to improve my skills to increase confidence and prepare for real world technical interviews in manageable self pace way. 
### Learning Objective 
With the completion of this project I aim to: 
Strengthen core Python/C programming skills 
Develop effective problem - solving strategies 
Gain Confidence in breaking down dolving technical coding questions 
Improve familiarity with key algorithms topics
Document learning growth through tracking and reflection.
Use python or C to use the display the data that I have collected throughout this project 
### Risk 
Involving two programming languages may prevent full understanding of one or the other 
Time constraints 
Difficulty with harder problems may cause me to get off track with my schedule and goals. 
Mitigation: Heaving to complete one language goals before moving on to the other and then having to stick to the schedule of problems that i want to get through 
### Project Assessment 
The project will be evaluated on: 
Completion of detailed problem solving tracker 
Weekly reflection journal with summaries of reviewed or newly learned concepts 
Final report summarizing key skills gain, trends in time managements and improvements, 
Evidence Of consistent structured practice over the 9-week period.

### Schedule: 
Rough Draft - I used Chat GPT to help me but this is preliminary!
