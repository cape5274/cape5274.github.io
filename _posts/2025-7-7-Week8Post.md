### What did you do last week?
Last week, I focused on catching up and getting back on track with my weekly practice problems in Python and C. I spent time reviewing concepts I was unsure about and making sure I stayed on schedule with the assignments. It helped feel more confident moving forward.

### What do you plan to do this week?
This week, I plan to stay consistent with my schedule. And then I am also just going to try to move ahead of the schedule if i have anyt time remainng due to a recent task i was given and then making sure to review previous work that was done as well. 

### Are there any impediments in your way ?
One unexpected challenge is that I’ve recently been asked to start learning R for my data management team position. That’s extra work to my weekly routine, so time management is going to be a key challenge for the rest of the project in order to learn efficiently

### Reflection on the process you used last week ,how can you make the process work better?
Looking back, I’m amazed of how much I’ve learned over the past few weeks, especially with Python. I’ve realized the importance of pacing myself and balancing review with new material and curveballs!
