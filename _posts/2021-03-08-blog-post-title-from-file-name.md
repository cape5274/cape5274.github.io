## Week 2 Post 

Date: 5/29/2025

### Introduction 
Last week, I completed the syllabus quiz, watched the course overview video, and familiarized myself with Canvas and the course materials. I then started to brainstorm project ideas for the semester. Currently, I am working as a student assistant on a Data Management Team, so I would like to incorporate skills I am learning from that experience or work on improving skills that I donâ€™t yet feel confident in but will need in this position

### Getting Started 
This week, I worked on getting my personal website up and running through GitHub (thanks to all of the helpful tips on Piazza!) and made sure that I am updating my posts on both my website and Piazza. In my current role on the Data Management Team, I am still relatively new to the team and the position. The main tools that will be used mainly include:
- Python
- SQL
- Tableu
I do not want to create a project that is too complex to complete on time or to present effectively. Since I am still training in my position and getting familiar with the role, I felt inspired by the Python example from another student that was shared from last semester and am considering basing my project on something similar.
 

### Coming up 
My main priority for this week is finalizing what I would like to focus on for my project, completing my project proposal, and creating a schedule to keep myself on track throughout the semester.
