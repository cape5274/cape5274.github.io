### What did you do last week?What did I do last week?
Last week, I kept working with my weekly schedule and took some time to reevaluate my goals for each topic. While working through coding problems, I noticed that some areas came easily to me while others took a significant amount of time and effort. I adjusted my original problem goal from tackling 4-5 coding problems per topic to 3 for one of the topics. This helped me dive deeper into the concepts without burning out.

### What do I plan to do this week?
This week, I’m focusing on staying consistent with logging my progress in my Excel file and sticking to the updated schedule. By keeping better track of my work I hope to stay more organized and reduce any last-minute scrambling the last few weeks.

### Are there any impediments in your way?
The biggest challenge right now is catching up on the time I lost last week while working through understanding some coding problems. I want to make sure I don’t fall behind and managing my time and adjust my expectations as needed.

### Reflection on the process:
I’m glad I took the time to reflect and adjust my goals and It’s been helpful to shift the focus from quantity to quality focused on deeper understanding on topics i wasn't as confident in. Going forward, I want to keep building on that mindset.
