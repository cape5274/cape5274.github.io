## Building a Strong Technical Background in Different Coding Laanguages 
This self-guided project focused on strengthening my foundational programming skills in **Python** and **C** through weekly practice, problem-solving, and progress tracking. Using platforms like **LeetCode**, **YouTube**, **LinkedIn Learning**, and GitHub tutorials, I worked through algorithmic challenges to prepare for technical interviews and real-world software development tasks.

Throughout the project, I analyzed my performance using Python scripts to generate visualizations, allowing me to track trends in time spent and problem-solving efficiency. The experience aligned closely with my concurrent software development internship, where Python became the primary language I used. Overall, this project helped reinforce the importance of consistent practice, time management, and continuous learning in the field of computer science.
